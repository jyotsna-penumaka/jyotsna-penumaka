Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Jyotsna Penumaka
=========================================================================================================================================

Hey there, I'm Jyotsna, a graduate student at Columbia University studying computer engineering, and I'm super passionate about using technology to create a safer world. I'm so grateful for my background in computer science and software development, and I'm always excited to learn more about programming languages like Python, Rust, C, C++, and Java.

I actually earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Boston University, where I was fortunate enough to receive the Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Award. During my time there, I also had the opportunity to work as a software engineer at Red Hat and as a software engineering intern at the same company. I've also dabbled in research as a research assistant at Boston University, where I analyzed the performance of security defense mechanisms.

If you're interested in my work, I've developed and implemented some pretty complex systems in operating systems, vulnerability, malware, and defensive systems. I'm really proud of those projects! Outside of work, I'm an avid runner and love to binge-watch TV shows. If you're looking for someone to chat with, I'm your gal.

Overall, I believe my expertise, skills, and experience make me a valuable addition to any team, and I'm excited about the potential for a successful career in the field of technology.
