Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Jyotsna Penumaka
=========================================================================================================================================

Hey there, how's it going? I'm Jyotsna, a graduate student at Columbia University studying computer science (security track). I absolutely love using technology to make the world a safer place! I feel incredibly fortunate to have a background in computer science and software development, and I'm always excited to learn more about programming languages like Python, Rust, C, C++, and Java.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Boston University, where I had some amazing opportunities like receiving the Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Award, and working as a software engineer at Red Hat as well as a software engineering intern. Plus, I even got to do some research as a research assistant at Boston University where I analyzed the performance of security defense mechanisms.

If you're curious about my work, I've developed and implemented some really cool systems in operating systems, vulnerability, malware, and defensive systems. And, one of my favorite projects involved [hacking Dating apps 💔](https://github.com/jyotsna-penumaka/Vulnerability-Analysis/blob/96aa12de5280c7135b0feea37e8194b81dd308ae/report.pdf)! On a lighter note, outside of work, I love running and binging TV shows. If you ever want to chat about running or the latest TV craze, I'm your girl!

Overall, I believe my expertise, skills, and experience make me a valuable addition to any team. I'm super excited about the potential for a successful career in the field of technology!
